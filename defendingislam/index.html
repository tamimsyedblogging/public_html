                <div class="panel-body">
                    <div class="panel-paragraph"><p>There are many people who claim Prophethood to fulfill their materialistic desires. If you look at Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) you will find that his life was better before, than after claiming Prophethood. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is so simple and used to sleep on mat made of straws which will put marks on his shoulders. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) told his companions that if the Arabs(who were hell bent on stopping the propagation of Islam) put Sun on one hand and the moon on the other hand, he won't give up this work of Dawah, inviting people to the truth.</p>
<p>Once his wives tried to pursue him for more luxurious life but Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) refused to do so and there was a revelation from Allah Almighty saying "O Prophet, say to your wives, "If you should desire the worldly life and its adornment, then come, I will provide for you and give you a gracious release.But if you should desire Allah and His Messenger and the home of the Hereafter - then indeed, Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward." Holy Quran 33:28-29. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) wives immediately repented and chosen the life of the Hereafter. I hope the facts presented here are sufficient to refute Claim no 1.</p></div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <div class="panel-paragraph"><p>Michael H Hart has written a book called "THE 100". The list of 100 influential people who ever walked the face of the Earth and he mentions Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) as the No. 1 influential person who ever walked the face of the Earth. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) led a simple life and he used to spend most of the days hungry for food and water. Some times he has to eat just a date palm for a day and some Honey. He doesn't have a fancy clothes to wear and no guards for his protection against Pagan Arabs and other tribes who were against his preaching. </p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) used to milk his goat and clean his home and assist his wives in household work. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) even accepts the invitation from the poor people and used to eat what was provided to him. His enemy used to pass comments on him saying "Oh he listen to Everybody". 
</p>
<p>There was a time when Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)'s son Ibrahim passed away and it coincide with the solar eclipse and people were telling that it was because of the death of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)'s son that we find heavens are too mourning.When Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) listen to this, he immediately told the people that the Sun and the moon are the symbol of Allah and it does not coincide because of the death and birth of any human being. If Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) wanted fame then he would have accepted that solar eclipse is due to his son demise but Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) does not do that because he is a true Prophet(Peace be upon him) of Allah.</p></div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <div class="panel-paragraph"><p>There is not even a single verse talking about the unity of the Arabs. In Holy Quran we have the concept of Ummah ie., The Nation. The nation which follows the rules set by the Allah Almighty through his glorious Holy Quran. Holy Quran talks about only the superiority of righteousness and there is no race or creed or nation or region or demographic are superior in the sight of Allah. Holy Quran says "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted." Holy Quran 49:13. We also have verses such as "Say, [O Muhammad], "If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people." Holy Quran 9:24 and also "And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it.</p>
<p>Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided." Holy Quran 3:103. If Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is the author of Holy Quran then why does it have such verses in it? Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is from Arab peninsula and he shouldn't be having such verses. Contrary to the Arab unity we also verses which talk Jews."O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the world's." Holy Quran 2:47 and also "And [mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world's." Holy Quran 3:40.Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is having his own wives and why does he choses Jewess for women above all nations?</p></div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <div class="panel-paragraph"><p>Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) wrote the Holy Quran from the knowledge, experience and events without knowing that he is the author of the Holy Quran. No person who has the illusion can be constant throughout the period of 22 and half years. Once a group came to the Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) to inquire about the Companions of the Cave. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) asked them to come tomorrow but the revelation did not come for next few days and Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) was worried and after a gap of few days the revelation started again.</p>
<p>Many people accepted Islam during this period as it shown to them that Holy Quran is not the handy work of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him). Holy Quran still has that verse "And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,Except [when adding], "If Allah wills." And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct." Holy Quran 18:23-24. We can see this verse even today. Why that verse still exist today? If he is the author of the Holy Quran? The answer is,Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is not the author of the Holy Quran.</p></div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <div class="panel-paragraph"><p>Orientalist say that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) learnt about Holy Quran from Roman Blacksmith from the outskirts of Mecca. But they fail to realize that Roman Blacksmith is a foreigner and this Holy Quran is a pure Arabic literature which Allah Almighty has send down from the heavens for all the mankind. It is also mention in the Holy Quran "And We certainly know that they say, "It is only a human being who teaches the Prophet." The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this Qur'an is [in] a clear Arabic language." Holy Quran 16:103. They also claim that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) learnt it from Waraqah. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) has met him just twice in his lifetime. One time before the prophethood and the other time was after the prophethood when he was shivering out of fear after seeing Angel Jibrael.</p>
<p>The Holy Quran was continuously revealed to the heart of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)  over the period of 22 and half years so it cannot be possible that he learnt it from Waraqah. They also claim that he learnt it from Jews and the Christian after migrating to Madhina and it took place after period of 13 years of revelation so that also cannot be possible. It was Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) who was giving guidance to them not the vice versa. Many Christian and Jews embraced Islam during these discussion. They also claim that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) learnt it from others outside of Mecca Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)  went outside of Arabia just thrice in his lifetime.</p>
<p>One when he was 6 years old,travelled to Madhina and one when he was 9-11 years old, travelled to Syria and the third when he was 25 years old during the business expedition to Syria. It is absurd to say that he learnt whole of Holy Quran in just 3 occassion. Holy Quran clearly mentions that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is unlettered meaning that he cannot read or write on his own. When the first revelation came to Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) it was said to him "Read..", Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) replied "am not learned". They also say that Holy Quran was copied from Holy Bible. Well, we agree that there is some similarities between them as the source of revelation for both is the same.The Almighty Allah.</p>
<p>But there are lot of scientific errors in the Bible which cannot be found in Holy Quran, not even one. The current Bible is full of concoction and words of historians and had been corrupted since the time of Jesus Christ(Peace be upon him). For example, In the chapter of Genesis it is mentioned that Almighty God created light and vegetation even before the creation of the Sun. It is not possible scientifically. It is also mentioned that the heaven and the earth was created in 6 days each of 24 hours . Holy Quran also talks about 6 days creation but does not give the time frame. It could mean a day, period or epoch. It is also mentioned in Holy Bible that the God Almighty created the 2 lights. One to rule the day and the other to rule the night. Holy Quran does not have these errors, why? because it was not copied from Bible. Holy Quran says "Blessed is He who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a [burning] lamp and luminous moon." Holy Quran 25:61</p></div>
